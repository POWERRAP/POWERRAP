# Python Portfolio - Mohamed el Kaddouri Aariba

Welcome to my repository where I will be uploading my projects made with Python.

I am currently studying a Python bootcamp at Tokio School and focusing on automations and, soon, on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Here you will find scripts, automation projects, and future developments related to AI.

Thank you for visiting!
